  🎮 Troubleshooting </h1> <p align="center">

If you see `Cannot instantiate C# script because...`
Godot .NET detects whether you are using C# in your project, and if you are it will reveal the "Build Project" (looks like a hammer) button to the left of "Run Project". However, when you import our addon into a Godot project that previously had no C# scripts, this button may not appear. Should this happen to you, simply navigate to and click on `Project > Tools > C# > Create C# Solution`. The "Build Project" hammer will no appear. Click it to build C# scripts and the message should go away.
