> [!NOTE]  
> In order to ensure smooth development with this addon we strongly recommend to use [Godot .NET 4.4](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/) and higher versions of the engine

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you import our addon into a Godot project that previously had no C# scripts, the "Build Project" button may not appear (the hammer button to the left of "Run project") and you might see `Cannot instantiate C# script because...` error in Godot's console. Should this happen to you, simply navigate to and click on `Project > Tools > C# > Create C# Solution`. The "Build Project" hammer will now appear. Click it to build C# scripts. Ideally, this should be done even before importing the addon to your project
